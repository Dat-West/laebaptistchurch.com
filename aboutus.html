		in the heart of Morobe. Our mission is to glorify God through worship, discipleship,
		 and service, and to share the love of Jesus Christ with our neighbors and the world.
		Founded in 1972, Lae Baptist Church has been a cornerstone of faith and fellowship in our

		congregation committed to living out the teachings of the Bible.
		Our mission is to make disciples of Jesus Christ by teaching the Word of God, fostering 
		spiritual growth, and serving our community with love and compassion. We believe in the 
		power of prayer, the importance of fellowship, and the call to evangelize.
		We hold to the core beliefs of the Christian faith, including the Trinity, the 
		divinity of Jesus Christ, and the authority of the Scriptures. We believe that salvation is a 
		gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ, and that we are called to live lives 
		that reflect His love and grace.
		At Lae Baptist Church, we are more than just a congregation; we are a family. We offer a 
		variety of ministries and programs for all ages, including Sunday School, youth groups, 
		Bible studies, and outreach initiatives. Whether you are new to the area or looking for a

		community.

				<h3>Pastor Morris B. Kanom</h3>
				
					<br><h4><b>Position:</b> Senior Pastor for Lae Baptist Church
					<br><b>From:</b>Gutzuap Village, Umi LLG, Markham District, Lae. Morobe Province
					<br><b>Age:</b> 49
					<br><b>Marital Status:</b>Married to Theresia Kanom

					<br>
					<br>Life Testimony</h4>
					<p>I was born and raised up in a Christian family. However, as I grew up to my youth, 
						completed my High School Education, and started working in the city and earning 
						salary, I was greatly influenced by the corrupted system of this fallen world.
						 I truly sinned against myself and against God through my bad conducts and actions.
						  My life testimony was so distorted and tarnished for doing evil and Satanic 
						  activities. One day, after taking alcohol or beer after work on Friday, 
						  I led a group of drunkard people and we went around in Lae city looking for dance. 
						  I still remembered that moment, as a Professional Salesman of the company, 
						  I have a lot of money. We were looking for dance everywhere and we ended up dancing
						   in a Crusade hosted at the Eriku Oval. That night, I surrendered my life to the
							Lord Jesus Christ. As I stood among the many who gave their lives to God that 
							night, I heard a whispering voice saying,<b><i> “Morris, you are a one of those 
							professional salesmen who always goes out and talks, sells, and convinces a
							 lot of customers to buy your company’s product. Today I will change that
							  technique around for my kingdom’s sake. I will use you – I will send you out
							   to sell my product, that is to preach my good news and bring more profit into 
							   my kingdom.”</i></b> After hearing that soft voice, I went straight to the company the
								next day and turned in my resignation. From there on, as I continue on 
								my walk with the Lord, praying and fasting, and showing my hunger and 
								thirst to God for His Word, the rest are history.
								 <b><i>I am Evangelist Morris B. Kanom, one of God’s Professional Salesmen, 
								 hallelujah!</i></b> 
						</p>
					<br><h4>Number Of Years in Evangelistic, Teaching, and Preaching Ministry</h4>
						<p>I have been serving God in the ministry of preaching, teaching, 
							and evangelizing for about a total of 17 years. I am serving God still.</p> 
						<br>
					<br><h4>View of Ministry</h4>
					<p>While serving God in Ministry during these 17 years, I came to realize that,
						 what God said during the time I surrendered my life to Him, has come to pass. 
						 In reality, I saw God working through my ministry bringing the lost souls 
						 back to Him. I have seen many lives changed and transformed when I preached, 
						 taught, and evangelized in many places during Sunday Services, Conferences, 
						 Crusades, Fellowship Nights, Men’s and Women’s retreat etc. God used me to bring
						  more profits into His kingdom – plundering hell and populating heaven 
						  is what the Word of God and Holy Spirit does in and through my ministry. 
						  Therefore, my view of ministry stands clear, and that is to people with God.</p>
					<br><h4>Personal Vision</h4>
					<p>My vision is to see Christians growing up in their spiritual growth to full maturity
				 by putting their faith in Christ Jesus. And not only that, but having an intimate
				  relationship with Christ and walking with Him every day exhibiting 
				  discipline attitudes would enable a believer to resist Satan and his 
				  deceptive plans.</p>
					<br><h4>Best Encouragement with Best Scriptures</h4>
					<p>If you want to grow stronger in Christ Jesus, you must love your Bible 
				and submit under the leading of the Holy Spirit. Showing your love for God’s Word
				 and allowing Holy Spirit to lead you would inspire your faith, love, and hope in 
				 Christ. God gave us His Word to provide courage, peace, and hope when we most need
				  it. You are not by yourself in facing hardships. We all face difficulties 
				  when we doubt God’s goodness and plan and need encouragement. 
				<br>
				Therefore, do not give up! Meditate on the Word of God Day and Night and remember
				 to keep them so that you continue to grow up strong in the Lord.

			<h3>Pastor Michael Seekey</h3>

			<br>
			<br>Life Testimony</h4>
			<p>I was born on the 16 th of August 1973. I did my grade one (1) 
				in 1984 up till grade seven (7) in 1991 where I could not further my education 
				due to lack of parental support.
				being a primary school drop out, and in a polygamous family, i was given less 
				attention and with depression and peer pressure led me to theft, home brew, drug 
				addition and the evil deeds of this world. People judged me with all kinds of 
				negativity and with the weight of this world on my shoulder, I decided to go to Jesus!
				in September 1998, I gave my life to Jesus! and from there, I was never the same again.
				 Jesus turned my world upside down. He took away all my burdens and gave me rest. He took 
				 away my bad reputation and gave me a new Identity. I realised the Best chose I made in
				  life was choosing to follow Jesus. I am now gladly serving God and always willing to 
				  travel to the ends of the world so that people that are imprisoned by darkness can
				   come to Light and be set free. 
				</p>
			<br><h4>Number Of Years in Preaching and Teaching Ministry</h4>
				<p>I have been serving God in the ministry of preaching, teaching, 
					and other association and Union related ministries for about
					 a total of 25 years till this day.</p> 
				<br>
			<br><h4>View of Ministry</h4>
			<p>Truly God's work requires life. In simple terms, to serve God is to give your time, 
				effort and commitment, and most of all to surrender all the pleasures of this world, 
				pickup your cross and follow Jesus where ever He leads you. After 
				surrendering my life to Jesus, I became a vessel for God to use. 
				I began to to Preach and teach the Word of God, reached out to people of all level with no expectation
			of getting anything in return but having the desire and the drive for souls to come to know who God is 
		and develop a meaningful relationship with their Maker.</p>
			<br><h4>Personal Vision</h4>
			<p>My vision as a servant of God and Jesus Christ is to make sure every soul I come
						 accross must learn a valuable lesson about Christian life and how to walk 
						 and live a Godly life. Also for the souls that I cannot reach in person 
						 should Hear and know about Jesus by supporting others pastor and Christians
						  who hunger to carry out the Gospel of Christ even to the ends of the world.</p>
			<br><h4>Best Encouragement with Best Scriptures</h4>
			<p>For this part, when I recall my testimony, I always have the delight and 
						an overwhelming peace to assure people that <b>the only safest place 
						in the world is to be in the Presence of God.</b> I was shackled by the chains of this world 
						being lost in darkness until i entered the church and gave myself completely to God.
						 Then onwards, God took the wheel and I was not the same anymore. If Jesus can do it for me, He 
						 can do it for you too. 
						 By far the best scripture verse for me as a preacher and it does not get old is;<br>
						 <b style="color: #ab0202;">Romans 1:16 <br>
						 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation
						 to everyone that believes; to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</b>
