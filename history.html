<b>Foundation and Early Years (1972-1980s)</b><br>
In 1972, a group of dedicated New Zealand Baptist missionaries arrived in Lae, Morobe Province
with a mission to serve the local community. They established Lae Baptist Church primarily to cater 
to the spiritual needs of students and lecturers attending and working in the University of Technology. 
Additionally, the church also served as a chapel for the employees of Tranwest Trucking Company,
providing a place of worship and community for those working in the area.
<br><b>Growth and Development (1980s-2000)</b><br>
During the 1980s and 1990s, the church continued to grow, becoming an integral part of the community.
It offered various programs and services to support the spiritual and social needs of its members. 
The church’s dual role as a place of worship for both the academic community and the trucking company 
employees helped it build a diverse and inclusive congregation.
<br><b>Transition to a Community Church (2000-Present)</b><br>
In the year 2000, Lae Baptist Church transitioned into a regular church, opening its doors to
all people in the community. This change marked a new chapter in the church’s history,
as it embraced a broader mission to welcome and serve everyone, regardless of their background.
Today, Lae Baptist Church stands as a vibrant and welcoming place of worship by fostering a 
sense of community and spiritual growth for all who enter its doors and a 
testament to the enduring legacy of the New Zealand Baptist missionaries who laid its foundation.
